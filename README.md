# | infix * |

All documented `infix` operators visible in `base`, organized into a table.

This webpage is different from other "Haskell operators cheat sheet" in that it includes *all* operators declared as `infix`, not just ones from `Prelude`.

## What are those `.replit` files?

I don't have access to a desktop environment for now; the Replit app is pretty much the only place I can develop something serious in.
